The Automatic File Sorter is a Python program that can sort files into different folders based on their file extensions. It uses the shutil module to move files to their respective folders, and the user can specify the path of the folder that needs to be sorted and the names of the folders where the different file types need to be moved. The program creates new folders if they do not exist, and it provides an efficient way to organize a cluttered folder by automating repetitive tasks and enhancing the efficiency of file management. This project demonstrates the proficiency of the developer in Python, their ability to work with file operations, and their problem-solving skills. Overall, this project is an excellent addition to the developer's portfolio and would be a valuable asset to any team that requires file management automation.
